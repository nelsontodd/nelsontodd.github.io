<blockquote>
  <p>â€˜[A systemâ€™s] lack of order or predictability; gradual decline into disorderâ€™</p>

<p>Chaos</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>â€˜behavior [of a system] so unpredictable as to appear random, owing to great sensitivity to small changes in conditions.â€™</p>

<p>On first glance, these two concepts are so similar as to appear synonymous. This is dangerous! Entropy and chaos are cousins and should never be confused.</p>
