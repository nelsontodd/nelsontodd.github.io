Entropy
>'[A system's] lack of order or predictability; gradual decline into disorder'

Chaos
>'behavior [of a system] so unpredictable as to appear random, owing to great sensitivity to small changes in conditions.'

On first glance, these two concepts are so similar as to appear synonymous. This is dangerous! Entropy and chaos are cousins and should never be confused.
